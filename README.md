MacOS26 **liquid glass** app icons for games running through Crossover.  
Feel free to use it, remix it, or make your own variant in Apple’s **Icon Composer**.

## Credits

Made with love by **@leodesca**, experimenting with Apple’s new MacOS Tahoe liquid-glass icon aesthetic.  
If you create something cool, a star or pull request is always appreciated! :star2:
